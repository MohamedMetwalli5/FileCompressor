# File Compressor
A C++ compression and decompression program based on the Huffman Algorithm.

## Introduction
This project is to design a compression and decompression program based on the Huffman Algorithm.
The idea of the Huffman Algorithm is to minimize the weighted expected length of the bits by means of assigning shorter bits to frequently-used characters and longer bits to seldom-used characters.

## Implementation Details
The programs can compress and decompress text files consisting of 128 ASCII characters.
